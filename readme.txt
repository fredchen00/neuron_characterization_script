generate a configuration file similar to config_h5.yaml and run abf_impedance_calc_all.py for analysis on multiple folders
the code generate a folder "result" at the data_file_path directory path. The plots generated include each individual trial as well as
the average of all trials. All the resonance frequnecy as well as 3dB (half amplitude of the resonant peak impedance) are included in impedance_info.xsls 
inside the result folder.
